# ISTQB CTFL 4.0 Course Notes

My notes from going through a instructor led istqb ctfl course in 2024.

View rendered site at: https://dalondaikhimokpa.github.io/istqb-ctfl-notes-2025/
To launch the site:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How this site was built

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with absolute or relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
